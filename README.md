# **Data Preprocessing and Analysis Project**

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on preparing a dataset for machine learning tasks by performing data preprocessing, including scaling, encoding, and feature engineering. The dataset contains a mix of numerical, categorical, and ordinal data, and this pipeline ensures the data is transformed correctly for downstream analysis or modeling.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Ordinal Encoding**: Encodes ordinal categorical variables based on a predefined mapping.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts non-ordinal categorical features into binary columns.
- **Standard Scaling**: Scales numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Combines all preprocessing steps into a unified `ColumnTransformer` pipeline.
- **Validation**: Provides methods to inspect and validate transformations.

---

## **Project Files**
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the data preprocessing pipeline, along with analysis and validation steps.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.
- Dataset files: Ensure your dataset is available in the working directory.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **How to Run**
1. Open the `data_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure your dataset is properly loaded into the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to preprocess the data, analyze results, and validate the pipeline.

## **Pipeline Overview**

### **Steps in the Pipeline**
1. **Numerical Features**: Scaled using `StandardScaler` for normalization.
2. **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.
3. **Ordinal Features**: Encoded using `OrdinalEncoder` with predefined mappings.
4. **Validation**: Cross-check transformations with the original dataset.

---

## **Validation Steps**
- Check transformed data for correctness.
- Inspect feature names and ensure transformations are applied correctly.
- Verify the shapes of original and processed data.
